# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING PYTORCH

This project is prepared as a final project for Computer Science MakeUp Module for Neuroengineering. The aim of this project is to turn the knowledge into application.

Tasks for Completing the Project is given below: 

1. Object Oriented Programming in Python
2. Learning PyTorch environment and Deep Learning in PyTorch
3. Train a simple sequential NN to predict the digital classes
4. Train a CNN to predict digit classes
5. Image Classification on Fashion Dataset (https://medium.com/ml2vec/intro-to-pytorch-with-image-classification-on-a-fashion-clothes-dataset-e589682df0c5)
