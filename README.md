# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING PYTORCH

I created this repository to help beginners in PYTORCH library. This repository is prepared as a final project for Computer Science MakeUp Module for Neuroengineering.

Learning process is divided into steps: 

1. Object Oriented Programming in Python
2. Learning PyTorch environment and Deep Learning in PyTorch
3. Train a simple sequential NN to predict the digit classes
4. Linear Classifiers and Two Layer Neural Network (Will be uploaded later.) 
5. Train a CNN to predict digit classes
6. Image Classification on Fashion Dataset (https://medium.com/ml2vec/intro-to-pytorch-with-image-classification-on-a-fashion-clothes-dataset-e589682df0c5)

#### 1. Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Topic is clearly introduced and exercises are very helpful for understanding the OOP in Pyhon. (https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
