# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING PYTORCH

I created this repository to help beginners in PYTORCH library. This repository is prepared as a final project for Computer Science MakeUp Module for Neuroengineering.

Learning process is divided into steps: 

1. Object Oriented Programming in Python
2. Learning PyTorch environment and Deep Learning in PyTorch
3. Train a simple sequential NN to predict the digit classes
4. Linear Classifiers and Two Layer Neural Network (Will be uploaded later.) 
5. Train a CNN to predict digit classes
6. Image Classification on Fashion Dataset (https://medium.com/ml2vec/intro-to-pytorch-with-image-classification-on-a-fashion-clothes-dataset-e589682df0c5)

#### 1. Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Topic is clearly introduced and exercises are very helpful for understanding the OOP in Pyhon. (https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
- CodeAcademy has nicely built exercises for classes in Python. Only downside is, these exercises are written for Python 2 and sometimes differences in syntax is confusing but I recommend to complete them. (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python/lessons/introduction-to-classes/exercises/why-use-classes?action=resume_content_item) 

#### 2. Learning PyTorch environment and Deep Learning in PyTorch
- Nice overview on existing Deep Learning Frameworks, I highly recommend to look at this website before starting PyTorch. (https://www.netguru.co/blog/deep-learning-frameworks-comparison)
- This link explains how to setup necessary environments for PyTorch. (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- As a last, I repeated the solved exercises. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html)

### 3. Train NN to predict the digit classes
- In the first exercise, two layer neural network is trained on MNIST dataset and the model is applied on test dataset.
- In the second exercise, convolutional neural network is trained on MNIST dataset and the model is applied on test dataset.
